RabRacer will be a game where you train,breed and race rabbits. Your goal is to become the wealthiest
most reknown rabit breeder/trainer in the world. I would like to implement at least two different game
modes. Sprint and endurance racing. Each type of racing requires different types of stats for your 
rabbit.
